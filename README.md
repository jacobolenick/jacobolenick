### Hi there, I'm Jacob Olenick 👋

I'm a Senior Product Designer @ Cisco Prev: Wells Fargo where I designed the platform Vantage & ParamountPlus where I owned the homepage design as well as all marquees and carousels, plus some other cool features. I am currently learning to code "again". 

👨‍🎓  I graduated NuCamp Coding Bootcamp with honors and was in the top 10% of all graduates in May of 2021. My tech stack is React, React Native, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, React Strap, Materialize CSS, Material UI, AJAX, Redux, JSON, and APIs.

In the future, my plan is to start a tech startup to bring my love of coding and entrepreneurship together.
